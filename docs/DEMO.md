# Lifeline Mesh: demo notes

Living document. Updated at the end of every phase.

## Current state (Phase 0)

What exists: project, theme, shared components, onboarding with permissions checklist, bottom navigation, Settings, component gallery.
What does not exist yet: mesh, packets, sending, rescue, map, AI. The four tabs say which phase brings them.
The status strip says "Mesh not running" and "Rules only" because neither the mesh service nor a model exists yet.

Nothing here has been verified on the three demo phones yet.

## Demo steps

Not ready. The 3-minute script in CLAUDE.md section 14 needs phases 2 to 7.

## Needs native-speaker review

Machine-drafted translations. Please have a native speaker check them before the demo:

- `app/src/main/res/values-hi/strings.xml` (Hindi): SOS flow, need and severity words, delivery status, onboarding, permissions checklist.
- `app/src/main/res/values-kn/strings.xml` (Kannada): same set.

Words to check first, because they appear on stage: "SOS के लिए दबाकर रखें" / "SOS ಗಾಗಿ ಒತ್ತಿ ಹಿಡಿಯಿರಿ" (Hold for SOS), "मदद आ रही है" / "ಸಹಾಯ ಬರುತ್ತಿದೆ" (Help is coming), "पास के फ़ोन का इंतज़ार" / "ಹತ್ತಿರದ ಫೋನ್‌ಗಾಗಿ ಕಾಯಲಾಗುತ್ತಿದೆ" (Waiting for a nearby phone).

Settings and developer screens are English only on purpose (DESIGN.md section 9).

## Known issues

- On vivo/iQOO, "Allow background activity" in the app's battery settings is a vendor switch the app cannot read. The checklist tick only reflects Android's battery-optimization exemption; the row tells the user to also open the app's battery settings.

## Needs real phones

- Install on all three phones, complete onboarding, grant every permission (Phase 0 "done when").
